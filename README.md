# Unity-Turn-Based-Tutorial
This is the repository that I'm going to upload my progress through a Turn Based 3D unity project from the course on GameDev.tv! The goal of this is learn about how strategy games like XCom and Fire Emblem do their grid base movement and combat!

The tutorial is the Unity Turn Based Strategy: Intermediate C# Coding on GameDev.tv and it walks you through how to setup movement and weapon use, as well as how to setup maps that the AI and the player are able to interact with. It will also go through a pathfinding for movement to do the most optimal route.
